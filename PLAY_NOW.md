## 🔊 Audio

The game uses **procedural audio** (generated music) since you haven't added audio files yet. This means:
- ✅ Music will play automatically
- ✅ No file downloads needed
- ✅ Perfectly synced to notes
- 🎼 Sounds like electronic/synth music

## 💡 Tips

1. **Watch the notes falling** - they give you ~2 seconds warning
2. **Listen to the beat** - procedural music has a clear rhythm
3. **Start with Easy** - get comfortable with the controls
4. **Build combos** - consecutive hits increase your score
5. **Miss = Combo reset** - screen shakes on miss!

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

**Game won't start?**
- Make sure http://localhost:5173 is working
- Check terminal - frontend should be running
- Refresh the page

**No sound?**
- Click the page to enable audio (browser requirement)
- Check browser audio isn't muted

**Notes feel off-time?**
